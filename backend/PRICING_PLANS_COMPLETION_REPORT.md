## Generated: June 12, 2025

### âœ… TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The pricing-plans feature backend implementation has been **COMPLETED** and is ready for production use.

## ðŸ“‹ COMPLETED COMPONENTS

### 1. Database Structure âœ…
- **Plans Table**: Created with full pricing structure (monthly, yearly, seat pricing)
- **Payment Methods Table**: Supports multiple payment types (cards, banks, digital wallets)
- **Subscriptions Table**: Handles user subscription management
- **Orders Table**: Tracks payment transactions and order history

- **PaymentMethod Model**: Ready for payment processing
- **Subscription Model**: Full relationship setup with users and plans
- **Order Model**: Includes order ID generation and status management

### 3. Controllers âœ…

- **PaymentController**: âœ… FIXED - Now creates subscriptions for both package AND seat plans
- **SubscriptionController**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED - Full CRUD with user authorization
- **OrderController**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED - Complete order management with statistics

### 4. Routes âœ…
All pricing-related API routes are properly registered and accessible:

#### Public Routes (No Auth Required)
- `GET /api/plans` - List all pricing plans
- `GET /api/plans/{id}` - Get specific plan details
- `GET /api/payment-methods` - List payment methods
- `POST /api/payment/calculate` - Calculate pricing

#### Protected Routes (Auth Required)
- `POST /api/payment/process` - Process payments
- `GET /api/payment/order/{orderId}` - Get order details
- `GET /api/subscriptions` - List user subscriptions
- `GET /api/subscriptions/{id}` - Get subscription details
- `PUT /api/subscriptions/{id}` - Update subscription
- `POST /api/subscriptions/{id}/cancel` - Cancel subscription
- `GET /api/orders` - List user orders

- `DELETE /api/plans/{id}` - Delete plan

### 5. Data Seeding âœ…
- **6 Pricing Plans**: 3 package plans (Starter, Lite, Pro) + 3 seat plans
- **8 Payment Methods**: Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) + Banks (BCA, BNI, BRI, Mandiri) + Digital (GoPay)
- **Pricing Structure**: 
  - Starter: FREE
  - Lite: IDR 25,000/month, IDR 20,000/month (yearly)
  - Pro: IDR 75,000/month, IDR 70,000/month (yearly)
  - Seat plans: IDR 15,000-25,000 per seat/month

### 6. Key Fixes Applied âœ…
- **PaymentController**: Fixed subscription creation logic to handle both package and seat plans
- **Carbon Date Methods**: Fixed `addYears()` to `addYear()` and `addMonths()` to `addMonth()`
- **Route Registration**: All pricing routes properly registered with correct middleware
- **Database Safety**: Confirmed no existing data was lost during setup
